#**Reboot's In-Depth High Velocity Library**
Ridhvl is a library designed to provide quick shortcuts and templates for game jams such as the *Ludum Dare* and *MiniLD*.

Admittedly, this library was designed with my own personal use in mind. However, pull requests that provide
*helpful* and *logical* additions will be accepted.

Ridhvl requires [Lwjgl 2](http://legacy.lwjgl.org/) and [slick-util](http://slick.ninjacave.com/) to function.
